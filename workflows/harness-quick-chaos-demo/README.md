## Requirements for the fake demo workflow 

- Ensure users are able to run it independently without impact to others' runs (which are going on in parallel)
- Eliminate the need for separate application instances and dedicated namespaces
- Reduce the workflow execution period to <5 minutes
- Ensure as close an experience as possible to real chaos workflows - i.e., chaosresuts, logs, parallel stages, cleanup etc.,
