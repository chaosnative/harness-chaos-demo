## Requirements for the fake demo workflow 

### Phase-1 

- [x] Ensure users are able to run it independently without impact to others' runs (which are going on in parallel)
- [x] Eliminate the need for separate application instances and dedicated namespaces
- [x] Reduce the workflow execution period to <5 minutes
- [x] Ensure as close an experience as possible to real chaos workflows - i.e., show chaosresuts, logs, parallel experiments & cleanup 
- [x] Allow for simple modifications/tuning to force failure (to show mix of passed and failed experiments) & non-100% resilience score
